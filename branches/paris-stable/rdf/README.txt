This is a place holder directory for storing resources on RDF.
IF we want to generate RDF representations of the data model, and possibly of instances,
here we can write RDF schema document etc. 
There could be a document similar to intermediateModel.xsd in that it defines HOW to define a model in RDF.
I.e. a translation of the IVOA UML Profile to an RDF schema document.
