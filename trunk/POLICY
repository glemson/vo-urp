This branch: Trunk
Owner: Gerard Lemson

Version Control Policy for the VO-URP Project

1) Every branch has an owner, and the owner decide who can make changes to
the branch, and what kind of changes they can make. The trunk is an
important branch, so the owner should be a somewhat cautious individual
(probably the project owner).

2) No one checks in broken code to a branch they're sharing with others,
unless they negotiate with them first.

3) Personal branches are like personal desks, and users can maintain them
in any way they want.
