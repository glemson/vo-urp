- [2009-05-13, GL] checkDB hangs
--==============================
on my laptop, during forceMakeAll, ant hangs at checkDB.
doing a makeAll afterwards, it passes
had this problem before, don't remember how I fixed it

I run ANT from within eclipse, the plugin version is 1.7.0v200706080842.

note, this started after updating log4j, build-java

(morning after)
Think it had something to do with (not) making other java calls in the same process 
as ANT. using fork="true" or so? Seems as if all fork-s are set to true.

Maybe something to do with http://ant.apache.org/faq.html#input-makes-exec-hang ?
So I added inputstring="" in all <java tasks and that seems to fix it!

-- [2009-05-23, GL] About INTERMEDIATE representation
--===========================================
In the VO=-URP generation pipeline the first step is to generate an "..._INTERMEDIATE.xml" document from the XMI.
This is a simplified version of the full UML, representing the IVOA UML profile in more explicit terms than XMI. 
It must follow the xsd/intermediateModel.xsd XML schema.

This document has at least 3 main usages.
First it greatly facilitates the writing of XSLT to generate other derived products.
Second it shields us from differences in XMI generated by different tools, only one generation script needs to be rewritten.
Third it easily allows different models to be derived (using XSLT for example) from a base model without requiring a UML representation of the latter.
Fourth it serves as a meta-model within the Java runtime. 


Some technical issues:
We generate the intermediate representation without any namespace indication.
This is so that the XSLT scripts become easier to write.
However when using the document in code we do need the namespace, otherwise the document will not parse against the JAXB classes generated
from the intermediateModel.xsd schema. Therefore we transform the document, after the generation of the derived products.
This happens in the build_java.xml's compileOutput target.
Note: when the targetschema changes this script should be changed !
currently it is
