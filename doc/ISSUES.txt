- [2009-05-13, GL] checkDB hangs
--==============================
during forceMakeAll, ant hangs at checkDB.
doing a makeAll afterwards, it passes
had this problem before, don't remember how I fixed it

TODO: ask Laurent ...
note, this started after updating log4j, build-java

(morning after)
Think it had something to do with (not) making other java calls in the same process 
as ANT. using fork="true" or so? Seems as if all fork-s are set to true.

Maybe something to do with http://ant.apache.org/faq.html#input-makes-exec-hang ?
SO I added inputstring="" in all <java tasks and that seems to fix it!
