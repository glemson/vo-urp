#summary Ideas for further developments.

= Introduction =
Laurent is visiting Garching, Aug 8-16 to work on VO-URP.
First brainstorming on status and required work.


= What is to be done =
  * Versioning of codes (metadata objects in general?). On one hand issue for SimDB, but may have generic solution.
    Possibly an issue when multiple instances mirror (part of) each others resources.
  * Constraints: refinement of container references
  * Data vs Metadata.
    In metadata one could describe where the data is stored. 
    E.g. table name, column names for attributes..
    Or generate a table with a foreign key to metadata table (halos to snapshot/simulation).
  * Generate template instance XML documents.
    Generate a default simulation for a given simulator.
  * Denormalisation of Resources for user friendly registration.
    Using XSLT, e.g. in SimDB.
    Idea: register XSLT scripts for a resources. Readonly, or readwrite.
  * Support a "view framework", more generically views of the resources or parts of resources in a model. Custom JPA queries, JSP pages.
  * Related: custom pages in vo-urp-browser.
    Extend controller?
    New cotrollers?
    Embed vo-urp browser insode other web application? Vice versa.
  * Make tables behave nicer on vo-urp browser (CSS issue)
  * Editing resources online
  * Pre-cooked but free ADQL queries. fix select and 1 from, rest free??
    Use case: allow querying of HydroCluster FOFs, link result to SMac/Splotch...
  *  


= Use cases for Views =
  * PDR
  * denormalisation
  * hydrosims
  * ...
