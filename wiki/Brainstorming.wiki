#summary Ideas for further developments.

= Introduction =
Laurent is visiting Garching, Aug 8-16 to work on VO-URP.
First brainstorming on status and required work.


= What is to be done =
  * Versioning of codes (metadata objects in general?). On one hand issue for SimDB, but may have generic solution.
    Possibly an issue when multiple instances mirror (part of) each others resources.
  * Constraints: refinement of container references
  * Data vs Metadata.
    In metadata one could describe where the data is stored. 
    E.g. table name, column names for attributes..
    Or generate a table with a foreign key to metadata table (halos to snapshot/simulation).
  * Generate template instance XML documents.
    Generate a default simulation for a given simulator.
  * Support a "view framework", more generically views of the resources in a model.
    Special case: denormalisation for user freiendly registration (e.g. in SimDB).
    Idea: register XSLT scripts for a resources. Readonly, or readwrite.
  * Custom pages in vo-urp-browser.
