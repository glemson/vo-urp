#summary This page presents the developer point of view about the VO-URP developments

= Introduction =

- Laurent : 
    vo-urp = javadoc + refactoring + dead / test code refactoring + memory leak tests to add


- Gerard : 
    volute = *SimDB DM + note : important*

# Functionalities to add / change

    XML Schemas : the XSD may be different and I think we should have two options :
      - use official googleCode XSD release : add a version 0.5 / 0.6 ...
      - use the last generated XSD (internal - dev) for our tests / developments

      The first one will be useful for STD compliance (research users); 
      the second one for dev compliance (you, rick, me & benjamin ...)

      3 tasks :
        - manage manually the folder : http://vo-urp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/input/simdb/xsd/
        - propose in the validator to choose between STD (+version) or DEV to use the internal schemas (local URL = simple FileServlet mapping in the web.xml)

        - Download the schemas : create a simple web page to list these files (FileServlet + directory listing) in tomcat or apache ?
