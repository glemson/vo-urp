#summary This page presents the developer point of view about the VO-URP developments


= Development tasks =

- Laurent : 
    vo-urp = javadoc + refactoring + dead / test code refactoring + memory leak tests to add


- Gerard : 
    volute = *SimDB DM + note : important*




= Functionalities =

  - XML Schemas : the XSD may be different and I think we should have two options :
      - use official googleCode XSD release : add a version 0.5 / 0.6 ...
      - use the last generated XSD (internal - dev) for our tests / developments

      The first one will be useful for STD compliance (research users); 
      the second one for dev compliance (you, rick, me & benjamin ...)

      3 tasks :
        - manage manually the folder : http://vo-urp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/input/simdb/xsd/
        - propose in the validator to choose between STD (+version) or DEV to use the internal schemas (local URL = simple FileServlet mapping in the web.xml)

        - Download the schemas : create a simple web page to list these files (FileServlet + directory listing) in tomcat or apache ?




= TODO List coming from a skype talk on 20/06/2009 =

- Issue No 6 :

> Laurent BourgÃ¨s : 
  0. javadoc / warning fixes
  0. dynamic logger's level support


  1. use interfaces for public API (root objects, DataModelManager ...)
  1. singletonsupport generalization

  2. threadlocal support / cleaner
  2. stringbuffer local optimisation

  3. Visitor for toString + processExport refs

  4. SimDBHelper for collection and several utility methods (findInCollection ...) as I did in pdrDB

  5. add voparis job engine (usfeul for TAP)


> Gerard Lemson : 
  0. add unit (default) into Field entity + a semantic reference for unit thesaurus
  0. Quantity.unit will be not used in the first SimDB : only for later purpose : add this constraint in the documentation (uml, note ...)

  1. ValidValue = add a double value to the string value
  1. Quantity re-design : rename to Literal to support both string and numerical values :
       + ValueLiteral
       |- StringLiteral  (string)
       |- NumericLiteral (double)



= TODO 2009-11-12 =
  * Get TAP implementation from Pat (other?) (LB, GL)
    * check metadata extraction, compare to Franz's ADQL Interpreter (GL)
  * Laurent's !JobRunner (LB)
     * merge with Pat's UWS implementation (!AstroGrid's?) (LB)
       * add external/legacy applications
       * add persistent queue
       * get UWS support
     * user management (combined with VO-URP webapp, separate module?) (LB) X
     * file management
       * use job id (unguessable) for directory
       * show jobs by querying job table, linking to archive
       * file store limit and/or clean up functions (cron?) (LB, GL)
     * queue
       * maximum number of jobs in queue per user
       * clean up queue, move finished jobs to jobs/user table (LB)
     * check use cases (Eyal, Klaus) (GL)
     * plugin concept for applications iso custom servlets. 
       Use UWS pattern from Pat, Spring? (LB, GL)
     * use remote server for job execution iso !JobRunner web app.
     * 
  * TAP only web interface, i.e. no browsing part, may be useful for really large databases. (LB, GL)
  * Use cases:
    * implement ObsTAP use case, maybe on ROSAT images (GL) X
    * check that SimDB specification works with VO-URP (GL) X
    * support Benjamin and Franck on PDR use case (LB,GL) X
  * incorporate XSLT generation changes from SimDB specification into VO-URP (GL) X
    * html generation
      * graphviz map
      * utypes
  * complete TAP metadata generation following TAP spec (GL) X
  * user management for upload of xml (LB)
  * flexible support for custom pages (LB)
  * multiple models in one context (LB)
  *
