#summary This page presents the developer point of view about the VO-URP developments

= Development tasks =

- Laurent : 
    vo-urp = javadoc + refactoring + dead / test code refactoring + memory leak tests to add


- Gerard : 
    volute = *SimDB DM + note : important*



= Functionalities =

  - XML Schemas : the XSD may be different and I think we should have two options :
      - use official googleCode XSD release : add a version 0.5 / 0.6 ...
      - use the last generated XSD (internal - dev) for our tests / developments

      The first one will be useful for STD compliance (research users); 
      the second one for dev compliance (you, rick, me & benjamin ...)

      3 tasks :
        - manage manually the folder : http://vo-urp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/input/simdb/xsd/
        - propose in the validator to choose between STD (+version) or DEV to use the internal schemas (local URL = simple FileServlet mapping in the web.xml)

        - Download the schemas : create a simple web page to list these files (FileServlet + directory listing) in tomcat or apache ?


# TODO List coming from a skype talk on 20/06/2009

- Issue No 6 :

> Laurent BourgÃ¨s : 
  0. javadoc / warning fixes
  0. dynamic logger's level support


  1. use interfaces for public API (root objects, DataModelManager ...)
  1. singletonsupport generalization

  2. threadlocal support / cleaner
  2. stringbuffer local optimisation

  3. Visitor for toString + processExport refs

  4. SimDBHelper for collection and several utility methods
(findInCollection ...) as I did in pdrDB

  5. add voparis job engine (usfeul for TAP)


> Gerard Lemson : 
  0. add unit (default) into Field entity + a semantic reference for unit
thesaurus
  0. Quantity.unit will be not used in the first SimDB : only for later
purpose : add this constraint in the documentation (uml, note ...)

  1. ValidValue = add a double value to the string value
  1. Quantity re-design : rename to Literal to support both string and
numerical values :
       + ValueLiteral
       |- StringLiteral  (string)
       |- NumericLiteral (double)
