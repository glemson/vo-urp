#summary How to start a new modelling project.
= Introduction =
Here we describe how one can use the VO-URP infrastructure to create a database etc for one's own data model.


= Steps =

== Preliminary ==
Have ant installed.
Have a copy of the community edition of MagicDraw. 
For the moment this should be 12.1, as the infrastructure is designed for its XMI version.
We are working on supporting version 16.5 and its corresponding later XMI version [TODO add XMI version number here].
Nice (...) feature of VO-URP is that it will work with any UML editor as long as one can translate it to our "intermediate representation".
For MD 16.5 a first attempt is made to do so with the xmi2intermediate_16.5.xsl file.

== Check out ==
Connect to subversion repository and check out the complete trunk.

== UML model. ==

Create an appropriately named copy of ehe ./input/template.
E.g. ./input/mymodel
Rename the UML model inside (template_DM.xml), e.g. to MyModel.xml.
Edit the model, taking into account design rules described HERE [TODO add link]. 

== Configuration ==

To get the model compiled and available as a web application requires some configuration.
